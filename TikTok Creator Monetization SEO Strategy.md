## Keyword Integration Recommendations

Each target keyword should be used **naturally and strategically** on relevant pages. For example, the homepage should include a primary term in its title and heading (e.g. “Free TikTok Money Calculator to Estimate Your Earnings”) and meta description, without overstuffing. The calculator tool page’s URL and H1 could use one of the primary keywords (e.g. `tiktok-earnings-calculator`). Secondary keywords belong in subheadings, page copy or FAQs (e.g. a FAQ titled “How much do TikTok creators earn?” or a blog post). Meta titles and descriptions on each page should incorporate at most one or two target keywords to maintain readability. Use synonyms and related phrases (e.g. **“TikTok earnings estimator,” “TikTok creator revenue”**) to avoid repetition.

&#x20;*Example TikTok influencer profile metrics (followers, likes, video count) used in an earnings calculation.* In practice, the calculator page might display fields for “followers,” “total likes,” etc., echoing keywords like “TikTok engagement rate” and “TikTok earnings estimate” in descriptive text. The homepage and tool pages can briefly explain the calculator’s purpose (e.g. “estimate your potential earnings from brand deals or ads”), embedding keywords like *TikTok money calculator* into page copy. Meanwhile, blog or FAQ entries can target long-tail queries (for example, using a question format: “**How much do TikTok creators earn per post?**”). Always ensure the keyword fits the sentence organically and that each page provides useful information, rather than simply repeating terms.

## Additional Content Topic Ideas

Beyond the core calculator, content themes can attract SEO traffic and serve as entry points. Useful topics include:

* **Typical TikTok Creator Earnings:** Provide data on what creators earn. *For instance, studies show creators with 50K–500K followers typically earn about **\$80–\$1,650** per sponsored TikTok post.*
* **TikTok Monetization Programs:** Explain official monetization (Creator Fund, Live gifts, etc.). *TikTok’s Creator Fund pays roughly **\$0.02–\$0.04 per 1,000 views**, so discuss this along with other revenue streams.*
* **Pricing Sponsored Posts:** Guide creators on setting rates. *The earnings calculator can help here – it “gives you a ballpark figure” to quote when negotiating brand deals.*
* **Boosting TikTok Engagement:** Offer tips to increase followers and interaction. *For example, improving engagement rate from 5.85% to 11.07% (as one case study shows) can significantly raise earnings potential.*
* **Top-Earning TikTok Influencers:** Profile high-earning creators. *Highlight that stars like MrBeast (114M followers) are among TikTok’s richest, earning multi-millions.*
* **Using TikTok SEO & Trends:** Teach how to use hashtags and keyword trends to grow audience (indirectly boosting monetization).

&#x20;*Screenshot of TikTok profile for top influencer MrBeast (114M followers).* This kind of content can draw readers curious about high earnings, while naturally linking back to the calculator tool. Each topic should naturally incorporate relevant keywords (e.g. in titles or headings) so that users searching “how much do TikTok creators make” or “increase TikTok revenue” find the site through these blog posts and FAQs.

**Sources:** TikTok usage and influencer stats (e.g. average engagement and earnings) support these recommendations. These references underscore the viability of our chosen keywords and topics.
